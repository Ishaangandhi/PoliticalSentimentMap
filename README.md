# PoliticalSentimentMap
Backend takes in 40 of the most recent tweets from each of the 50 US Governor's verified Twitter accounts, and uses Indico's political sentiment analysis to determine the ideology behind these tweets. It synthesizes sentiment readings into a txt file.  Javascript displays each governor's political idealogy from the txt file, as determined by their tweets, onto a simple webpage featuring a US map using a color coordinated key.
